<h2> How this is working? </h2>
<h4> To play the game, simply run the main() method in the TicTacToe class. The game will prompt each player to enter their move by specifying a row (1-3) and column (1-3) on the board. The game will end when either a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
